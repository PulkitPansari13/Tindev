## Regular dating apps?...Naah
You are a *DEVELOPER* who changes the world, one deployemnt at a time! You need something **exclusive**, not the one which every ordinary human looking ape uses.
The one which caters to your hyperintelligent, logical, coffee-to-code turner personality.

**How its exclusive?**

You can **login only via github**, so you can keep everyday people at bay.

BTW, I could have asked you to invert a binary tree, but I didn't wanted to flex my programming skills and push you down the imposter syndrome hell ;)

>*"Good Relationship, like wine, takes time."* - someone on internet

Yeah okay, but first, you need to start with a relationship! Start at [Tindev](https://tindev-1.web.app/).

*****IF you are a DEV, you should be on TINDEV !*****

If not, why are you on github?
